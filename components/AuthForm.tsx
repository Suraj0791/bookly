/**
 * These are the "Props" or properties our AuthForm component needs to work.
 * Think of it as a contract: "If you want to use me, you MUST give me these things."
 *
 * We use a TypeScript Generic `<T extends FieldValues>` to make this component reusable.
 *
 * What does `<T extends FieldValues>` mean in simple terms?
 * - `T` is a placeholder for a specific form's data shape. It's like a variable for types.
 * - `FieldValues` is a basic type from react-hook-form that just means "an object with some fields".
 * - `extends` is a constraint.
 * - So, `T extends FieldValues` means: "You can use any object shape for `T`, as long as it's a valid
 * form data object." This lets us use the same form component for both a simple sign-in form
 * (e.g., { email, password }) and a more complex sign-up form (e.g., { email, password, name, etc. }).
